## üìù Implementation Log

### 2025-01-18
- Created clod.md for resource tracking
- Created implementation-progress.md for progress tracking
- Successfully logged into Cloudflare via wrangler
- Created Workers project: personality-spark-api
- Created D1 database: personality-spark-db (ID: 0e844e2c-54e1-4122-bab1-698fc86be2f6)
- Created KV namespaces:
  - personality-spark-sessions (ID: 643c50b21e5d44aca5f49c84a509a40d)
  - personality-spark-cache (ID: c79fa3abb6d949d5aa540373fbb9fe4a)
- Created R2 buckets: personality-spark-media, personality-spark-backups, personality-spark-files
- Created wrangler.toml configuration file
- Note: Queues require paid plan, will implement alternative solution
- Implemented complete Workers API backend with Hono framework
- Created all API endpoints (quizzes, ai, share, user, analytics)
- Implemented authentication with JWT
- Added rate limiting with Durable Objects
- Integrated Workers AI with fallback logic
- Set up D1, KV, and R2 bindings
- Added comprehensive error handling and security
- Created test suite with Vitest
- Configured Cloudflare Pages for frontend deployment
- Updated webpack configuration for production builds
- Added security headers and redirects for Pages
- Created comprehensive deployment documentation
- Fixed wrangler.jsonc with actual resource IDs
- Deployed Workers API to https://personality-spark-api.mabdulrahim.workers.dev
- Created test-api.js for endpoint verification
- Created setup-secrets.sh for secret configuration
- API is live and responding with compressed responses

## üêõ Issues & Resolutions

### Issue 1: Queues require paid plan
- **Problem**: Cannot create Queues on free plan
- **Solution**: Implemented alternative using Durable Objects for rate limiting and KV for task queuing

### Issue 2: Durable Objects on free plan
- **Problem**: Error deploying with `new_classes` on free plan
- **Solution**: Changed to `new_sqlite_classes` in migrations configuration

### Issue 3: Database migration conflict
- **Problem**: Remote database already had existing tables
- **Solution**: Tables already exist, no migration needed for existing schema
