- Still meets quality standards with research backing
- Consider acceptable for deployment

**File Not Found Warnings:**
- Articles are distributed across different numbered files
- Only relevant files are updated (3-5 files per article typically)
- This is expected behavior, not an error

**Processing Failures:**
- Check article ID spelling and format
- Ensure all file paths are accessible
- Review error messages in progress tracker

## Deployment Workflow

1. **Process Articles**: Use single or batch processor
2. **Review Changes**: Check generated content quality
3. **Commit Updates**: `git add . && git commit -m "Update batch of articles"`
4. **Push Changes**: `git push origin main`
5. **Monitor Deployment**: Check that articles appear correctly

## Performance Metrics
