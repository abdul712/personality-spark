<h2>Passive-Aggressive Notes</h2>
<p>Passive-aggressive notes can be a subtle yet impactful form of communication that may indicate underlying tension or unresolved issues between roommates. When you find passive-aggressive notes in your shared living space, it's essential to address them promptly to avoid further escalation.

<h2>Avoidance of Common Areas</h2>
<p>When roommates avoid common areas, it can indicate a lack of interest in social interactions and shared activities. This behavior may lead to a sense of isolation and discomfort within the living space.</p>
<p>Understanding the reasons behind this avoidance can help address any underlying issues and improve the living situation for all involved.</p>
<h3>Limited Social Interactions</h3>
<p>One common indicator that your roommate may not like you is if they consistently avoid common areas where social interactions typically take place. This behavior can stem from various reasons, such as a preference for personal space or social anxiety.</p>
<p>Here are three possible explanations for limited social interactions with your roommate:</p>

<h3>Lack of Shared Activities</h3>
<p>A noticeable indication that your roommate may not have a positive relationship with you is their consistent avoidance of shared activities and common areas within your living space. This behavior can lead to a lack of bonding and communication, ultimately affecting the overall living environment.
