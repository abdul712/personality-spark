<h2>Attention-Seeking Behavior</h2>
<p>Engaging in attention-seeking behavior can often stem from a deep-rooted need for validation and acknowledgment from others. Individuals who exhibit attention-seeking tendencies may do so out of a desire to feel seen, heard, and valued by those around them. This behavior can manifest in various ways, such as constantly seeking compliments, dominating conversations, or resorting to dramatic actions to attract attention.</p>
<p>Moreover, attention-seeking behavior can sometimes be linked to a lack of empathy and selfish behavior.
