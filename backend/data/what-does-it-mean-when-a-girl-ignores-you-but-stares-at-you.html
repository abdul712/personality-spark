<h2>Testing Your Reaction</h2>

<h2>Staring Out of Habit</h2>

<p>People may stare unintentionally, especially when they are caught up in their own thoughts or reminiscing about the past. It is possible that you remind her of someone she knows or a past experience, causing her to stare without even realizing it.

<h2>Wants to Make You Jealous</h2>
