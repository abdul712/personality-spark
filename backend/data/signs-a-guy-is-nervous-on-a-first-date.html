<h2>Body Language Cues</h2>
<p>When observing body language cues during a first date, it is essential to pay attention to subtle signs that may indicate nervousness in a guy.

<h2>Excessive Sweating</h2>
<p>In the realm of first date nerves, another telltale sign that a guy may be feeling anxious or stressed is excessive sweating, which can manifest as a physical indicator of heightened discomfort and nervousness.

<p>Factors such as hygiene and clothing choice can also contribute to sweating on a first date.

<h2>Lack of Eye Contact</h2>
<p>A notable indicator of nervousness in a guy during a first date is the avoidance of direct eye contact, which can convey a sense of unease or discomfort in social interactions. When someone is feeling anxious, they may find it challenging to maintain eye contact as it can feel intimidating or vulnerable. This behavior can stem from a fear of being judged or a lack of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence" target="_blank" rel="noopener">confidence</a> in themselves.</p>
