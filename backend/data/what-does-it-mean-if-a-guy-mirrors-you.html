<h2>Mirroring for Building Rapport</h2>

<h2>When Mirroring Indicates Deception</h2>
<p>In certain contexts, the act of mirroring behaviors can be a subtle yet telling indicator of potential deception within interpersonal interactions.

It's essential to trust your instincts and observe for patterns of behavior that feel disingenuous or calculated.
