<p>Male anatomy, like any other aspect of the human body, varies greatly among individuals. It is essential to recognize that size does not correlate with masculinity, virility, or sexual prowess.

<p>Let's move away from perpetuating harmful beliefs and embrace a more compassionate and informed perspective on male anatomy and gender expectations.</p>
