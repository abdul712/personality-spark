<h2>Signs of a Toxic Relationship</h2>
<p>When faced with consistent mean behavior from your girlfriend, it is important to examine the dynamics of your relationship and be aware of potential signs of toxicity. While occasional disagreements and conflicts are normal in any relationship, a toxic girlfriend may exhibit patterns of behavior that go beyond healthy boundaries.</p>
<p>One of the signs of a toxic relationship is constant criticism and belittlement. If your girlfriend frequently puts you down, insults you, or undermines your self-esteem, it is a red flag.</p>

<p>Furthermore, a toxic girlfriend may display possessive and controlling behavior. She might demand constant attention, become jealous easily, or try to control who you spend time with.</p>
<p>Recognizing these signs is crucial in evaluating the health of your relationship. If you identify with any of these behaviors, it is important to seek support, set boundaries, and consider seeking professional help to address the toxicity in your relationship. Remember, everyone deserves to be treated with kindness, respect, and understanding.</p>
