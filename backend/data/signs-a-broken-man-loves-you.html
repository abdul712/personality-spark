<h2>Protective Behavior</h2>
<p>In relationships, a broken man may exhibit protective behavior as a way of expressing his love and care for his partner.

This behavior can manifest in various supportive gestures, such as always wanting to walk on the side of the road closer to traffic, ensuring the partner's safety first, or being overly cautious in potentially risky situations.</p>
<p>A broken man's protective instincts can also be seen in his readiness to confront any challenges or threats that may arise, as he wants to create a sense of security and stability for his partner. This behavior is not only a reflection of his love but also a way for him to regain a sense of control and purpose in his life. Understanding and appreciating these protective gestures can help strengthen the bond between partners and foster a deeper sense of trust and connection in the relationship.</p>
