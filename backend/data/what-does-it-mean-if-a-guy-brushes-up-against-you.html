<h2>Accidental Brushing</h2>
<p>In social settings, accidental brushing against others can often occur, leading to moments of discomfort or unease for those involved.

Some people may be more sensitive to physical contact than others, and respecting personal boundaries is key to avoiding misunderstandings. Being aware of non-verbal cues and actively listening to verbal communication can help navigate such situations with sensitivity and awareness. Open and honest communication can also help clarify any unintended actions and prevent future discomfort.
