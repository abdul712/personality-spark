# Cloudflare Deployment Status

## Current Deployment Configuration

### Deployment URL
- https://personality-spark-api.mabdulrahim.workers.dev

### Worker Configuration (wrangler.toml)
- Worker Name: personality-spark-api
- Main Entry: personality-spark-api/src/index.ts
- Static Assets: personality-spark-api/public (using [site] bucket)

### Resources Created
All resources are tracked in `clod.md`:
- D1 Database: personality-spark-db
- KV Namespaces: SESSIONS, CACHE
- R2 Buckets: STORAGE, MEDIA, BACKUPS, FILES
- Durable Objects: RateLimiter

### Current Issue
The Worker is returning a 500 error when trying to serve static files. The issue is that the Worker code expects an `ASSETS` binding but the wrangler.toml uses `[site]` configuration which works differently.

### Solution
Need to update the Worker code to properly handle static file serving with Workers Sites configuration.

## Deployment Workflow
1. Code changes are pushed to GitHub
2. Cloudflare automatically builds and deploys via GitHub integration
3. NO manual `wrangler deploy` commands should be used

## Next Steps
1. Fix the static file serving in the Worker code
2. Test locally before pushing
3. Push to GitHub for auto-deployment
4. Wait a few minutes for deployment to complete
5. Test the live site
