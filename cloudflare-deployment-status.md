# Cloudflare Deployment Status

## Current Deployment Configuration

### Deployment URL
- https://personality-spark-api.mabdulrahim.workers.dev

### Worker Configuration (wrangler.toml)
- Worker Name: personality-spark-api
- Main Entry: personality-spark-api/src/index.ts
- Static Assets: personality-spark-api/public (using [site] bucket)

### Resources Created
All resources are tracked in `clod.md`:
- D1 Database: personality-spark-db
- KV Namespaces: SESSIONS, CACHE
- R2 Buckets: STORAGE, MEDIA, BACKUPS, FILES
- Durable Objects: RateLimiter

### Current Issue
The Worker is returning a 500 error when trying to serve static files. The issue is that the Worker code expects an `ASSETS` binding but the wrangler.toml uses `[site]` configuration which works differently.

### Solution
Need to update the Worker code to properly handle static file serving with Workers Sites configuration.

## Deployment Workflow
1. Code changes are pushed to GitHub
2. Cloudflare automatically builds and deploys via GitHub integration
3. NO manual `wrangler deploy` commands should be used

## Fix Applied (2025-01-19)
1. ‚úÖ Updated wrangler.toml to use [assets] instead of deprecated [site] configuration
2. ‚úÖ Added ASSETS binding and not_found_handling for SPA routing
3. ‚úÖ Tested locally - Worker starts successfully with ASSETS binding
4. ‚úÖ Pushed to GitHub at [timestamp] for auto-deployment
5. ‚è≥ Waiting 3-5 minutes for Cloudflare to complete deployment
6. üîÑ Will test live site after deployment completes

## Timeline
- Issue detected: Server returning 500 error with compressed data
- Root cause: Worker using deprecated [site] configuration
- Fix applied: Updated to modern [assets] configuration
- Deployment triggered: Via GitHub push (commit: 9f00b53)
